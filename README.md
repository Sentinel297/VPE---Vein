<h1>Mechanics explained here:</h1>

Revenants/Losts are creature that feed on human blood to keep themselves sane, a Revenant which does not consume blood in time will become a mindless beast known as a Lost.

Revenants are pretty similar to Sanguophages, the only way to truly kill one is by destroying their heart. They additionally possess the ability to use a "Drain Attack" on their enemies to directly drain blood from a target, this attack may also allow the Revenant to drain the following:

Skill levels
Genes
Abilities
Special abilities from certain anomalies.

Losts will resurrect after a delay which can be modified in the mod settings, there is no real way to kill a Lost (unless settings prohibit their resurrection).
